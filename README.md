### Premise

2d top down (or isometric) ace combat like arcade dogfight shooter

fight horrors from another dimension due to reckless greed fueled experimentation form \[corporation or government]

### Aesthetic

I enjoy shoot em ups like Bytepath but feel restricted by the locked screen view

Like afterBurner but more top down or isometric and restricted to one horizontal plane of action

I like the mini map and weapons display in ace combat

Like aerofighters in terms of graphical complexity but with the ability to turn and fly around a map instead of being locked into a single directional scroller

### Themes

what ideas can I convey in a 2d airplane shooter?

- quality over quantity 
- anti corprate 

super natural aspects?

arcade?

military?

retro?

### Features:
	
- weapons: guns, missiles, bombs
	- limited weapon range
	- stretch: elemental types with resistance/effectiveness?
- defense: spin to reflect projectiles, if spin too much get dizzy and  controls randomized temporarily 
- projectiles have travel time, need to lead shots
	- stretch: indicator on where to lead your shots boased on current velocity like in ace combat
- objectives: defend ground allies, destroy targets
- stretch: levels, buy upgrades to plane between levels
- win condition: kill all enemies, complete all objectives
- lose condition: get shot down, fail objective
 
### Name Ideas:

Aileron (I like this one)
Dogfight
Skywar
Ace... something

### Mechanics
#### Controls
#### View

"chessboard on a lazy susan"

## Unity engine

Linux, windows, mac platforms

2d or 3d engine locked in plane?

assets available for both. more for 3d

2d sprites easier to make 
### 2d
16 bit graphics

- commission sister?
- isometric
	- "paper cutouts" to show parallax
	- kinda like paper Mario
	- have left, right, front, back views of sprites?
- top down
	- difficult to show what you could crash into
	- outline everything player can crash into in red?

### 3d

- found low poly space ship pack
- use 3d models but lock everything into "plane of action" added complexity?
- potential for non-euclidean levels. inside / outside of sphere. over scope?
